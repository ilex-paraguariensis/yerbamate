## What is Mate?

## Quick Start
Install a model:
```bash
mate install ilex-paraguariensis/ResNet
```
Then train it:
```bash
mate train ResNet
```
The best performing model is saved, along with all of the training hyperparameters, test results, and training logs.

If however you want to test a model once again, you can run:
```bash
mate test ResNet
```
Example commands:

## Create your own packages

```
mate install https://gitlab.com/fancyExampleName/fancyModelRepo

```
mate install ilex-paraguariensis/ResNet
```
