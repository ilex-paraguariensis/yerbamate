<h1 style="color:green"><span style="color:green">Maté 🧉</span> your modular AI project and experiment manager</h1>

<!-- Maté is a python project, package and experiment manager. Whether you are a
seasoned deep learning researcher or just starting out, Maté provides you with
the tools to easily add source code and dependencies of models, trainers, and
data loaders to your projects. With Maté, you can also evaluate, train, and keep
track of your experiments with ease 🚀 -->
### Welcome to [Maté](https://github.com/oalee/yerbamate)! 🎉👋🏼

Maté is an open science modular Python framework designed to streamline and simplify the development and management of machine learning projects. It was developed to address the reproducibility crisis in artificial intelligence research by promoting open science and accessible AI. 🌍💻

The framework is built around the best software engineering practices of modularity and separation of concerns, encouraging quality coding, collaboration, and the sharing of models, trainers, data loaders, and knowledge. The modular design and separation of concerns simplify the development and maintenance of machine learning models, leading to an improved developer experience. 🚀💻👨‍💻💬🧠

With Maté, you can easily install the source code of open-source projects and adhere to modularity and separation of concerns, making your models and modules sharable out of the box. This means you can collaborate more effectively with others and easily share your work. 📦💻🤝

Thank you for choosing Maté, and we can't wait to see the amazing machine learning projects you'll create with it! 🎉👨‍💻🌟

## Features 🎉
- Seamless integration with any python library such as PyTorch/Lightning, TensorFlow/Keras, JAX/Flax, Huggingface/transformers. 🤝🤗🐉

## Installation 🔌

```bash
pip install yerbamate
```

## Quick Start ⚡

### **Initialize a project**

```bash
mate init deepnet
```

This will generate the following empty project structure:

```bash
/
|-- models/
|   |-- __init__.py
|-- experiments/
|   |-- __init__.py
|-- trainers/
|   |-- __init__.py
|-- data/
|   |-- __init__.py
```

### **Install an experiment**

To install an experiment, you can use `mate install` to install a module and its
dependencies from a github repository. See
[docs](https://oalee.github.io/yerbamate/#/?id=mate-install) for more details.

```bash
# Short version of GitHub URL https://github.com/oalee/big_transfer/tree/master/big_transfer/experiments/bit
mate install oalee/big_transfer/experiments/bit -yo pip

# Short version of GitHub URL https://github.com/oalee/deep-vision/tree/main/deepnet/experiments/resnet
mate install oalee/deep-vision/deepnet/experiments/resnet -yo pip
```

### **Install a module**

You can install independant modules such as models, trainers, and data loaders
from github projects that follow the
[Independent modular project structure](https://oalee.github.io/yerbamate/#/?id=project-structure-%f0%9f%93%81).

```bash
mate install oalee/lightweight-gan/lgan/trainers/lgan 
mate install oalee/big_transfer/models/bit -yo pip
mate install oalee/deep-vision/deepnet/models/vit_pytorch -yo pip
mate install oalee/deep-vision/deepnet/trainers/classification -yo pip
```

### **Setting up environment**

Set up your environment before running your experiments. This can be done by using shell, or `env.json` file in the root of your project. Maté API requires `results` to be set in the environment. For more information, see [docs](https://oalee.github.io/yerbamate/#/?id=mat%c3%a9-environment-api).
```bash
DATA_PATH=/path/to/data
results=/path/to/results
```
```json
{
    "DATA_PATH": "/path/to/data",
    "results": "/path/to/results"
}
```

### **Train a model**

To train a model, you can use the `mate train` command. This command will train
the model with the specified experiment. For example, to train the an experiment
called `learn` in the `bit` module, you can use the following command:

```bash
mate train bit learn
# or alternatively use python
python -m deepnet.experiments.bit.learn train
```

## Project Structure 📁

Deep learning projects can be organized into the following structure with
modularity and seperation of concerns in mind. This offers a clean and organized
codebase that is easy to maintain and is sharable out-of-the-box.
The modular structure of the framework involves organizing the project directory in a hierarchical tree structure, with an arbitrary name given to the root project directory by the user. The project is then broken down into distinct concerns such as models, data, trainers, experiments, analyzers, and simulators, each with its own subdirectory. Within each concern, modules can be defined with their own subdirectories, such as specific models, trainers, data loaders, data augmentations, or loss functions.

```bash
└── project_name
    ├── data
    │   ├── my_independent_data_loader
    │   └── __init__.py
    ├── experiments
    │   ├── my_awesome_experiment
    │   └── __init__.py
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── models
    │   ├── awesomenet
    │   └── __init__.py
    └── trainers
        ├── big_brain_trainer
        └── __init__.py
```

### Modularity

Modularity is a software design principle that focuses on creating
self-contained, reusable and interchangeable components. In the context of a
deep learning project, modularity means creating three independent standalone
modules for models, trainers and data. This allows for a more organized,
maintainable and sharable project structure. The forth module, experiments, is
not independent, but rather combines the three modules together to create a
complete experiment.

### Independent Modules

Yerbamate prioritizes the organization of the project into independent modules when applicable. Independent modules only depend on Python dependencies (such as NumPy, PyTorch, TensorFlow, or Hugging Face), and the code inside the module uses relative imports to import within the module. This makes it an independent module that can be re-used when Python dependencies are installed.

### Non-Independent Modules
In some cases, a combination of independent modules may be necessary for a particular concern. An example of this is the experiment concern, which imports and combines models, data, and trainers to define and create a specific experiment. In such cases, the module is not independent and is designed to combine the previously defined independent modules. In the case of non-independent modules, Yerbamate creates a dependency list of independent modules that can be used to install the code and Python dependencies. This ensures that the necessary modules are installed, and that the code can be run without issue.


### Sample Modular Project Structure

This structure highlights modularity and seperation of concerns. The `models`,
`data` and `trainers` modules are independent and can be used in any project.
The `experiments` module is not independent, but rather combines the three
modules together to create a complete experiment.
